DESlab
========
    DESlab a scientific computing program written in python
    for the development of algorithms for analysis and synthesis
    of discrete event systems (DES) modeled as automata.
    The main objective of DESlab is to provide a unified tool 
    that integrates automata, graph algorithms, and numerical
    calculations. DESlab also allows the definition of symbolic
    variables of type automaton and incorporates concise
    instructions to manipulate, operate, analyze and visualize
    these variables, with a syntax and an abstraction level close
    to the notation used in DES theory
